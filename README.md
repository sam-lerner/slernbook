## Description

This project represents the back end of a social media website. It consists of a database and a server with routes to various data.

The project utilizes `Express.js`, `mongoose` and a `MongoDB` database. This is not a deployed application, so all routes were tested through `Insomnia`

## Installation

In order to run this application, it is first necessary to step throught the `git clone` proceedure to create a local copy. Once this is complete, running `npm i` in your terminal will allow you to install dependencies. Once this is complete, you may either run `npm start` or `npm dev` to start the server. The latter option will activate running through `nodemon`, which will allow automatic server restarts after changes are made to the code. <span style="color:red">Please note that you will need to ensure your terminal is opened in the correct file structure in order to step through this process.</span>
